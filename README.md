## HDX Monitor Service to Calculate the Stats of Organizations
At times, an organization would like to know general stats about how their datasets are doing. CKAN's base functionality doesn't provide a total count of downloads that datasets and resources have much less a time-series of how they are performing. This service addresses those needs by creating a simple HTTP JSON API that both calculate and tracks that functionality.
